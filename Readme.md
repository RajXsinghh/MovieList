# MovieList Project

## Overview
The **MovieList** project is a web application where users can add, view, and delete movies from their personal list. It functions similarly to a To-Do List but is tailored for managing movie entries. This project is designed to help me learn and understand key concepts in JavaScript .

## Features
- **Add Movie:** Users can input the title of a movie they want to add to their list.
- **View Movie List:** All added movies are displayed in a list format.
- **Delete Movie:** Users can remove movies from their list with a simple click.

## Technology Stack
- **JavaScript:** Core scripting language for adding functionality.
- **HTML/CSS:** For structuring and styling the user interface.

## Learning Goals
The primary goal of this project is to:
- Deepen my knowledge of JavaScript by applying core concepts in a real-world scenario.

## Future Improvements
